# Home K8s Cluster

> Home IPv6-only Flux-managed K8s cluster on Talos+Alpine.

## üìñ Overview

This repository contains Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps config files
for managing my hobby cluster in the basement. Inspired by popular repos like
[toboshii/home-ops], with a few addicional considerations:


- **üõ†Ô∏è Unconventional hardware:** As much as I enjoy automating the software
  infrastructure, I also really like building custom hardware to power it all.
  I spend maybe half the time in front of the ‚å®Ô∏è keyboard and half the time
  using ü™öü™õ power tools.
- **üå≥ Low footprint:** All of the nodes are either old machines I am no longer
  using, or used machines I bought for very cheap. Many use passive cooling.
- **6Ô∏è‚É£ IPv6-only networking:** The cluster itself does not use IPv4, except for the jumphost server. Outbound IPv4 connections go through a Squid HTTP proxy that can reach IPv4 hosts.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ IPv6 networking

Currently the machines in the cluster are connected to to the router that
Swisscom provides us, through cheap 1 Gbps switches that only do L2
forwarding. This router advertises two IPv6 prefixes:

- A `scope global`, `dynamic` prefix that belongs to the `2000::/3` range.
- A `scope global` static prefix in the `fd00::/8` range. This appears to be the prefix
  `fdaa:bbcc:ddee:0/64` on these modems.

For the initial OS bootstrap, I'm using the auto-configured addresses. Once I can talk to the machines, I'm giving them static IPs in the `fd10:8::/64` range.

TODO: Configure `radvd` on the jumphost?

The router has IPv6 pinholing configured to access the load balancers from the outside.
Cloudflare sits in front of the them and provides IPv4 connectivity.

For the service and pod subnets, I'm using IPv6-only networks too:

- `fd10:96::/108` in place of the usual `10.96.0.0/12` service subnet.
- `fd10:244::/64` in place of the usual `10.244.0.0/16` pod subnet.

Currently `pool.ntp.org` has no AAAA records, so I'm using
`time.cloudflare.com` for time servers.

For DNS I'm using the usual public servers:

- `2001:4860:4860::8844` / `8.8.4.4` (Google 1)
- `2001:4860:4860::8888` / `8.8.8.8` (Google 2)
- `2606:4700:4700::1001` / `1.0.0.1` (CloudFlare 1)
- `2606:4700:4700::1111` / `1.1.1.1` (CloudFlare 2)

Some container registries currently don't have AAAA records either. To pull container images, I have a Squid caching proxy on the same jumphost that provides VPN management access.

Additionally, GitHub.com also doesn't have AAAA records as of now. This means
Flux CD cannot pull updates. As a workaround I'm hosting [a mirror of this repo][2] on GitLab.

## üßë‚ÄçüíªÔ∏è Dev/Ops

The easiest way to get the required dependencies is to have `nix` and `direnv`
configured. Entering the repo will execute the [`.envrc` file], which in turn
will `use flake` to pull in dependencies from the `flake.nix` file.

[`.envrc` file]: https://github.com/attilaolah/ops/blob/main/.envrc

Without `direnv`, one would need to manually run `nix develop` to enter the
development shell.

## üí° Inspiration

Much of this was inspired by a number of similar repos:

## üöß Under Construction

There is an existing repository where I already have most of these configs,
however it contains various secrets that are not properly extracted out. This
is an attempt to migrate exsting configs and redact any secrets.
